# Graded-Assignment-on-Statistical-Analysis-for-Healthcare-Management

### This repository focuses on performing statistical analysis for HealthCare Plus, a multi-specialty hospital, to optimize its operations, improve patient care, and reduce unnecessary expenses. The data collected includes patient admission times, recovery durations, satisfaction scores, staffing levels, and more. Key analyses include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), variance and standard deviation, hypothesis testing, correlation studies, and probability distributions, all aimed at offering insights for informed decision-making.

### The project also involves hypothesis testing for validating operational claims, analyzing relationships between nurse staffing and recovery times, and assessing the impact of treatment methods on recovery duration. Additionally, probability distributions like the Poisson distribution are applied to model emergency department cases and predict the impact of changes in hospital operations. This comprehensive approach aids in understanding the data and guiding hospital management towards more effective strategies for improving patient care and operational efficiency.
